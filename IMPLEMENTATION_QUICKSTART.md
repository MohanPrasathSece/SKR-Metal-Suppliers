## 🎯 **STRATEGY OVERVIEW**

### **Core Principle:**
**OWN PROBLEMS, NOT KEYWORDS**

Instead of competing for:
- ❌ "buy umbrella washers" (impossible to rank)
- ❌ "best metal washers" (saturated)
- ❌ "cheap washers coimbatore" (race to bottom)

You now rank for:
- ✅ "why do roofing washers fail" (ZERO competition)
- ✅ "washer installation mistakes" (LOW competition)
- ✅ "how to choose metal washers" (LOW competition)

**Why This Works:**
1. Low/zero competition = faster rankings
2. Educational content = authority building
3. Authority = commercial keywords follow automatically
4. Future-proof against Google updates
