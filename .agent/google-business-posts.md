## POST #1: Technical Education (Problem-Solution)
**Topic:** How umbrella washers help reduce leakage in metal roofing

### Post Content:
Metal roof leaks often start at fastener points where washers fail to maintain proper seal compression. Umbrella washers are designed to distribute load across a larger surface area compared to flat washers, helping reduce bearing stress on thin sheet metal. This design helps maintain waterproof seal integrity over time. We supply galvanized iron and stainless steel umbrella washers for industrial and commercial roofing projects in Coimbatore and Tamil Nadu. Call 9025421149 for technical guidance on sizing and material selection.

- ✅ Natural keyword placement
- ✅ Local + product keywords

## POST #2: Material Comparison (Decision Support)
**Topic:** GI vs SS washers for coastal environments

### Post Content:
Coastal areas accelerate metal corrosion due to salt exposure. Galvanized iron washers can show rust within 6-12 years in marine environments, while stainless steel (SS 304/316) washers offer longer service life. The choice depends on project budget and expected roof lifespan. We stock both GI and SS umbrella and bitumen washers in standard sizes. For high-humidity or coastal installations in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, contact us for material-specific recommendations. Available for bulk orders with technical consultation.

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Helps buyer decision-making
- ✅ Honest about limitations (GI lifespan)
- ✅ No "best" claims, just facts
- ✅ Geographic relevance (coastal)
- ✅ Educational authority

## POST #3: Installation Knowledge (Mistake Prevention)
**Topic:** Common washer installation mistake causing premature roof failures

### Post Content:
Over-tightening roofing fasteners is a common installation error that compresses washers beyond design limits. This causes the metal sheet to dimple, creating stress concentration points that can tear during thermal expansion cycles. Proper installation requires tightening until the washer makes firm contact, then adding only a quarter turn. We provide installation guidance along with washer supply for contractors and builders in Coimbatore. Technical support available at 9025421149.

- ✅ Helps DIY + professional audience
- ✅ Builds trust through education

## POST #4: Sizing Guidance (Technical Tool)
**Topic:** How to match washer diameter to sheet gauge

### Post Content:
Washer size selection depends on sheet metal thickness. Under-sized washers create excessive bearing stress, causing fasteners to pull through during wind uplift. For 0.35-0.40mm sheets, minimum 19mm diameter is recommended. For 0.50mm and above, 25mm+ umbrella washers help distribute load safely. We can assist with washer sizing calculations based on your sheet specifications and wind zone requirements. Contact our technical team in Coimbatore for project-specific selection guidance.

## POST #5: Maintenance Awareness (Replacement Market)
**Topic:** Signs your roofing washers may need replacement

### Post Content:
Roofing washers typically show warning signs before complete failure. Look for surface cracking of rubber seals, visible rust staining on sheets, or gaps between washer and metal surface. In moderate climates, washers generally last 12-20 years, but coastal or industrial environments may reduce this to 6-12 years. Early detection allows preventive replacement before water damage occurs. We supply replacement washers matched to existing installations. For inspection guidance or bulk replacement requirements, reach us at 9025421149.
